This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

```{r Import}
install.packages("odbc")
install.packages("DBI")
install.packages("dpylr")
```

```{r Test connection to PAHO}
library(odbc)
library(DBI)
library(dpylr)

```

```{r Possible token}

```



```{r Connect to Paho}
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odb(),
                 Driver = "SQ Server"
                 Server = "ec2-18-191-74-137.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com"
                 Database = "paho_flu_system_dev"   
                 trusted_connection = "yes")

```

```{r Query Data}

```

```{r View Data}

```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
